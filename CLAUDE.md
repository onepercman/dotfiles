# CLAUDE.md

AI assistant instructions for this dotfiles repository. For general documentation, stack overview, scripts, and troubleshooting — see **[README.md](./README.md)**.

## Design Philosophy

1. **One script**: `sync.sh` is the single entry point — install, update, repair. No per-tool install scripts.
2. **Modular**: each Stow package is self-contained. Files symlink to `$HOME` via `stow -t "$HOME"`.
3. **Dotfiles win**: conflicts resolved by removing the target file, never creating backups.
4. **Minimal**: no abstractions beyond what the tools need.

## AI Assistant Rules

### 1. Always use Stow

- Never create custom symlink scripts or backup files
- Use `stow -t "$HOME" -R <package>` for all symlink operations
- Detect conflicts with `stow -n`, remove conflicting files, then stow

### 2. One script philosophy

- `sync.sh` is the single entry point: `./sync.sh` to install, `./sync.sh uninstall` to remove
- When adding a package: add to `PACKAGES` in `sync.sh` only

### 3. Conventions

- Stow package dirs: lowercase
- Scripts: `set -euo pipefail`, helpers: `ok/run/warn/abort/section/section_end/spin/spin_ok/spin_warn`
- No banners, no prompts (except destructive ops in `sync.sh uninstall`)
- Commit style: emoji prefix (`🚀 🐞 🔧 ♻️ 📝 🗑️ ⬆️`)

### 4. When adding features

1. Create/update Stow package directory
2. Add package to `PACKAGES` in `sync.sh`
3. Add to `Brewfile` if installable via Homebrew
4. **Update docs** (see rule 5)

### 5. Keep docs in sync

**Mandatory check before every commit**: if the change touches a config file, a package dir, or `sync.sh` — scan `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for any mention of what changed and update it in the same commit. No exceptions.

Trigger → what to update:

| Change | Doc to update |
|--------|--------------|
| Add/remove a tool or package | `README.md` Stack + Stow Packages table; `CLAUDE.md` Directory Structure |
| Add/remove a Stow package dir | Same as above |
| Change `sync.sh` behavior or helpers | `README.md` Scripts table; `CLAUDE.md` Conventions helpers list |
| New user-facing capability | `README.md` Highlights |
| New AI rule or convention | `CLAUDE.md` AI Assistant Rules |

**Verification step** — before marking a doc edit done:
1. `grep` or `Read` the actual config file to confirm each stated fact
2. Cross-check `PACKAGES` in `sync.sh` against the Stow Packages table in `README.md` — they must match exactly
3. Cross-check `CLAUDE.md` Directory Structure against the actual package dirs on disk

**Do not** document: ephemeral state, current branch, per-package config values (theme names, font sizes, keybinds) — those live in the config file and go stale. `README.md` stays at Stack/Highlights altitude.

### 6. Unified theming

Every themed terminal tool in this repo stays synced to the single unified theme (currently TokyoNight Night — see README.md "Unified theme" line).

- If the tool has a built-in named preset for the theme (e.g. Ghostty's `theme = TokyoNight Night`, btop's `tokyo-night.theme`), set that preset — never hand-author colors when a preset exists.
- If the tool has no matching built-in preset, hand-author a custom theme file using the same hex palette already in use by the other hand-authored configs in this repo (starship is the existing example — reuse its exact hex values instead of inventing new ones).
- **Exception: lazygit.** It intentionally carries no `gui.theme` hex overrides — it falls back to its default ANSI-named colors, which inherit Ghostty's active terminal palette directly. Do not hand-author hex for it even though it has no built-in preset by name; this is a deliberate deviation from the rule above.
- If the unified theme ever changes (e.g. TokyoNight → something else), update every themed package in this repo in the same change (lazygit needs no edit, since it inherits automatically). Never leave the repo partially migrated between themes.
